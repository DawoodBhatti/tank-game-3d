# tank-game-3d – Powered by Godot 4
prototyping my first 3d game

A minimalist prototype inspired by *Wild Metal Country* and *Deep Rock Galactic*  
🧠 Procedural terrain meets chunky tank combat and dynamic environment destruction.

## 🚀 Features

| Feature              | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌄 Procedural Hills  | Uses OpenSimplexNoise to generate undulating terrain via mesh deformation. |
| 🛞 Tank Physics      | Simple RigidBody3D or CharacterBody3D controller with turret rotation.     |
| 💥 Fireable Shells   | Instanced projectile scenes with collision detection and explosion effects.|
| 🧨 Destructible World| Voxel-style terrain or GridMap tiles that react to shell impacts.          |
