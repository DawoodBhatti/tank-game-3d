prototyping my first 3d game


#  🧱 1. Procedural Hills
Use OpenSimplexNoise or FastNoiseLite to generate terrain heightmaps.

PROCEDURAL GENERATION - Godot Mini-Course walks through mesh generation, noise setup, and terrain shaping.

How to Create PROCEDURAL Generation in Godot 4 shows how to integrate procedural terrain into a game scene using the Gaea plugin.

You’ll generate a mesh grid, sample noise for each vertex, and displace it vertically to form hills.

#  🛞 2. Basic Tank Controller
Use a RigidBody3D or CharacterBody3D for your tank.

Add movement with torque or directional forces

Rotate turret separately using input

Fire shells using instanced RigidBody3D projectiles

You can start with a simple cube and cylinder setup for the tank body and turret — no need for fancy models yet.

#  💥 3. Fireable Shells
Create a shell scene:

Use RigidBody3D with collision and gravity

Add a trail or particle effect for visual feedback

On impact, detect collision and trigger terrain damage

You can use raycasting or area detection to simulate explosive force.

#  🧨 4. Destructible Environment
This is the trickiest part, but still achievable.

Fully Destructible 3D Environments - Godot 4 FPS Tutorial shows how to use GridMap and CSG nodes to create destructible terrain.

You can remove or modify tiles on impact, or use boolean mesh operations to “carve” terrain.

Start with voxel-style terrain or modular chunks to simplify destruction logic.

#  🧪 Prototype Scope
You could build a playable prototype in 1–2 weeks if you:

Keep visuals minimal (use primitives)

Focus on one terrain chunk

Limit shell types and destruction radius
